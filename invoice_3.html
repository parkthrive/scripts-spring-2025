        <p>This letter serves as the <strong>FINAL NOTICE</strong> regarding the unpaid parking fine associated with your vehicle that was parked without authorization at the private parking lot located at {{lot location}} on {{citation date}} at {{citation time}}. We are writing on behalf of and as an agent of the owners and/or managers of the aforementioned private parking lot.</p>
        
        <p>Despite our previous communications, including notices sent on {{first mailer}} and {{second mailer}}, we still have not received payment for the outstanding amount of ${{value}}. More than 30 days have passed since the first notice was sent to you, rendering your account delinquent.</p>
        
        <p>NOTE THAT IF PAYMENT IS NOT RECEIVED PROMPTLY, THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS MAY BE TAKEN:</p>
        <div class="actions">
            <p>a.) Forwarding your account to a collections agency for debt recovery procedures, which may adversely affect your credit rating.</p>
            <p>b.) Revoking the parking privileges at any of our locations nationwide due to unpaid parking fees. If the vehicle in question (or any other vehicle registered in your name) is found parked at any of our locations nationwide, the vehicle may be subject to towing at your expense - potentially without additional notice.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Please understand that these actions are a consequence of the failure to settle the parking fine as agreed upon by the Terms and Conditions of parking that were clearly posted at the specified location.</p>
        
        <p>This is a subsequent attempt to collect a debt. Information obtained will be used for that purpose.

Parking Collect, and the owner/manager(s) of the private parking lot are not governmental entities.</p>
